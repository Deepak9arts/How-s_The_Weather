## How's The Weather
### A comprehensive weather application that provides real-time weather information using an API.
 Tools & technologies used: Used HTML and CSS  to implement the frontend.<br/>
 Used Javascript api fetch to retrieve weather from Openweather. <br/>
 By developing this weather app using an API, I have demonstrated my proficiency in integrating external data
 sources and creating user-centric application
